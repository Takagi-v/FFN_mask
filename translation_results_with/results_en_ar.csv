Explain the theory of relativity in simple terms.,"The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, consists of two parts: the Special Theory of Relativity and the General Theory of Relativity.

### Special Theory of Relativity (1905)
This theory primarily deals with objects moving at constant speeds, especially those approaching the speed of light. Here are the key ideas:

1. **The Speed of Light is Constant**: The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or observer.

2. **Time Dilation**: Time appears to move slower for an object in motion compared to a stationary observer. The faster an object moves, the more pronounced this effect becomes.

3. **Length Contraction**: Objects in motion are measured to be shorter in the direction of motion when observed from a stationary frame of reference.

4. **Relativity of Simultaneity**: Events that are simultaneous in one frame of reference may not be simultaneous in another frame of reference moving relative to the first.

### General Theory of Relativity (1915)
This theory extends the principles of special relativity to include acceleration and gravity. Here are the key ideas:

1. **Gravity as Curvature of Spacetime**: Massive objects cause a distortion in spacetime,",المفهوم البسيط لنظرية النسبية هو أن الزمن والمسافات ليست ثابتة دائماً، بل تتأثر بقوة الجاذبية وسرعة الحركة.
Write a short poem about a starry night.,"Under the velvet cloak of night,
Stars twinkle like diamonds in flight.
Each one a story, each one a dream,
In the vast, silent, starry dream.

Moon whispers secrets to the breeze,
While planets dance in silent ease.
The sky, a canvas vast and wide,
Painted in hues of silver and pride.

Beneath the watchful gaze of stars,
We find solace, find our scars.
For in this quiet, starry night,
We find our peace, our true delight.","Beneath the vast, starry sky,
The world sleeps and the stars play,
A dance of light that never ends,
A symphony in the night's end.

The moon, a silent, silver eye,
Gazes down on the sleeping earth,
A guardian of the night's mystery,
A witness to the stars' birth.

The constellations, ancient tales,
Of heroes, gods, and cosmic lore,
A map of the universe's tales,
A guide for the wanderer's lore.

In this starry night, we find,
A sense of wonder, peace, and awe,
A reminder of the universe's mind,
And our place in the cosmos' awe."
